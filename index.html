                <h2>About CompassView Guesthouse</h2>
                <p>Compass View offer accommodation for up to 7 guests.
This newly renovated very cosy cottage is a step back in time but with all the modern amenities. There are 3 bedrooms with 3 en-suite bathrooms. Well-equipped open plan kitchen and lounge area with a Morso open fire place to set the stage for a romantic Karoo sleep over in the heart of our very charming Nieu-Bethesda which will not be forgotten soon.
Our guests enjoy the privacy and comfort of not sharing the cottage with someone else.

The main bedroom has a queen size bed with an en-suite bathroom with a walk in shower and slipper bath. The second bedroom has queen size bed in the one room that walks out on the back patio and the garden, en-suite bathroom with a walk in shower. The third bedroom has 2 single beds (we can add a third single bed per request) and an ensuite-bathroom with a beautiful clawfoot bath. All rooms are equipped with electric blankets, heaters, fans and hair dryers. The outside braai area is perfect for the lovely Karoo summer evenings under the stars. The front patio has a lovely view on the nearby mountains and people watching and wine on the front stoep with the water in the old "leiwater" system running at your feet is just magical. If you are lucky then the horses that's roaming free will graze past the stoep.

A wake up call with breakfast in bed or on the stoep can be arranged.
Compass View is within walking distance from the Owl House, several restaurants, Kitching Fossil museum, Bushman Heritage Museum, five studios and galleries, Cement crafters and Donkey Cart rides.

Nieu-Bethesda is a natural oasis, and was started in 1875 as a church town and gained municipal states in 1886. Nieu-Bethesda is probably the only town in South Africa where we can still experience the calm, relaxing and peaceful life our forefathers lived a hundred years ago in our lovely South Africa with our gravel roads, no liquor stores, no gas stations, no ATMs, no court, no street lights, lots of peace, joy, respect and love. Children playing in the river as the local swimming pool, the horse and donkey carts a normal transport method, the rooster announcing the break of day, and everybody stroll safely, respect, greet, and chat to friends and strangers on the street.</p>
